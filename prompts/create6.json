    "context" : "You are creating a data lineage test set. The test set is designated to measure the quality of a lineage tool. The tool has one main functionality - it can identify the \"used for creation\" relation between relations. The test set is designed to be used with the Microsoft Northwind database. The test set is written in Transactional SQL (T-SQL). Try to cover as many settings, common schemes and motives as possible. Describe each section of the set. Consider the following lineage scenarios: a view is created upon a data source. This view is used to create another table. Upon this table, with a new temporary table is created with use of a procedure. Then, the temporary table is used by a procedure to create a new table. The task is to recognize lineage between the new table and all consequent data sources, up until the original data source. The second scenario includes creating a view, a new table upon this view and then usage of a procedure to create the new table.",
