    "context" : "You are creating a data lineage test set. The test set is designated to measure the quality of a lineage tool. The tool has one main functionality - it can identify the \"used for creation\" relation between relations. The test set is designed to be used with the Microsoft Northwind database. The test set is written in Transactional SQL (T-SQL). Try to cover as many settings, common schemes and motives as possible. Describe each section of the set. Remember to use VARCHAR(255) datatype to store all numeric data. Put your notes and comments into proper SQL comments sections.",
    "task" : "You will be provided a full lineage scenario. Transform the code, so that each transformation is stored within lineage tables in the database. The lineage table contains information on what row in a view, temporary table or a table was generated with use of what row from the origin. Use cursors to achieve the goal. You will now be given three code samples, the first one is an example of a data lineage scenario. The second one adapts the scenario to data lineage task. The third one provides a scenario for you to process. Your task is to adapt the third scenario into the data lineage task."
